# Currency-Note-analysis
Sometimes when someone deposite a sum of large money into bank, it is very time consuming for bank staffs to check each note authentication. In such case machine learning algorithms come to play. They simply put the money into a machine which according to some machine learning model, predicts wheather the note is authentic or not. There are many machine learning models used for such classifications, but here we focus on only three out of them

1.Logistic Regression

2.Support Vector Machine (SVM)

3.kNeighbors classification

#Logistic regression:

Logistic regression estimates the probability of an event occurring, such as occured or didn't occured, based on a given dataset of independent variables. Since the outcome is a probability, the dependent variable is bounded between 0 and 1

#Support vector machine:

It is used to handle both classification and regression on linear and non-linear data. SVMs are used in applications like handwriting recognition, intrusion detection, face detection, email classification, gene classification, and in web pages.


#kNeighbors classification:

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.
